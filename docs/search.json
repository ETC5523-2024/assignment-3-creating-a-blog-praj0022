    "text": "I am currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in Business Analytics at Monash University, where I am deepening my expertise in data analysis and statistical modeling. With a background in Android development, I previously worked at Zebra Technologies, developing data extraction applications that empowered enterprises to streamline their operations through robust mobile solutions.\nMy passion lies in exploring mental health data due to its complex and unpredictable nature, which presents unique challenges and opportunities for discovery. I am particularly interested in leveraging advanced analytics and machine learning to uncover patterns that can enhance our understanding of mental health trends and interventions.\nIn addition to my technical pursuits, I am committed to using data-driven insights to address real-world problems, especially those with social impact. I am continually honing my skills in areas like predictive modeling, data visualization, and data storytelling, aiming to bridge the gap between data science and meaningful change."
